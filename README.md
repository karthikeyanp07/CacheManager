# CacheManager
CacheManager is a utility class that provides a singleton instance of a persistent media cache using SimpleCache from androidx.media3. It enables efficient offline media playback and data reuse by storing streamed content locally.

In androidx.media3, SimpleCache is part of the media3-datasource module and works seamlessly with the ExoPlayer-based player. It uses a CacheEvictor (like LeastRecentlyUsedCacheEvictor) to manage disk usage, and a DatabaseProvider to store cache metadata.

✅ Purpose
	•	Store media data locally for offline access
	•	Improve performance by avoiding repeated downloads
	•	Reduce network usage
	•	Manage cache size and eviction policy automatically

 🧩 Key Components Used
	•	SimpleCache – stores media on disk
	•	CacheEvictor – manages when to evict data (e.g., LRU strategy)
	•	DatabaseProvider – stores cache metadata using SQLite
	•	StandaloneDatabaseProvider – convenient implementation of DatabaseProvider

 🧠 Why It’s Needed
With androidx.media3, media caching remains a core feature for streaming apps, especially when:
	•	Offline playback is needed
	•	Network efficiency is a priority
	•	You want fine-grained control over caching behavior
